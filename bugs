fix:

1. getline with no argument - after a space won't quit with Ctrl d
e.g
$ _ _ _ (CTRL D)
(_ is space)

2. ^@ (mull) character in getline

3. exit_shell_func and seg fault when sh_info is unused (i.e at first call which was terminated immediately with CTRL D) ... should sh_info be malloc'ed?

add:
4. environment variable in form ${var}
5. backtick `cmd` should send output to stdout and stdin
